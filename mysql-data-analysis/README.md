# MySQL Data Analysis Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of MySQL scripts for data management, analysis, and exploration. The scripts are organized into several key sections to help with various data-related tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Staging Table Creation**: Create a staging table to work with raw data.
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries from datasets.
   - **Standardize Data**: Clean and standardize data entries for consistency.
   - **Handle Null Values**: Manage and clean null values to ensure data quality.
   - **Remove Unnecessary Data**: Drop columns or rows that are not needed.

2. **Stored Procedures**:
   - **Basic Procedures**: Create and call simple stored procedures to encapsulate queries.
   - **Complex Procedures**: Manage more complex stored procedures using delimiters and blocks.

3. **Triggers**:
   - **Basic Triggers**: Set up triggers to automatically execute actions based on data changes.
   - **Example**: Update related tables or perform actions upon data insertion.

4. **Events**:
   - **Scheduled Events**: Create events for scheduled tasks such as periodic data cleanup or updates.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Basic Queries**: Perform initial data exploration to identify key statistics and outliers.
   - **Aggregate Analysis**: Group and aggregate data to uncover trends and patterns.
   - **Advanced Analysis**: Use CTEs and window functions for deeper insights and rolling calculations.
